asn1js
======

asn1js is a JavaScript generic ASN.1 parser/decoder that can decode any valid ASN.1 DER or BER structures.

An example page that can decode Base64-encoded (raw base64, PEM armoring and `begin-base64` are recognized) or Hex-encoded (or local files with some browsers) is included and can be used both [online on the official website](https://asn1js.eu/) or [offline (ZIP file)](https://lapo.it/asn1js/asn1js.zip) by opening `index-local.html`.

Usage with `nodejs`
-------------------

This package can be installed with either npm or yarn via the following commands:

```sh
npm install @lapo/asn1js
# or other tools
pnpm install @lapo/asn1js
yarn add @lapo/asn1js
```

You can import the classes like this:

```js
import { ASN1 } from '@lapo/asn1js';
```

A submodule of this package can also be imported:

```js
import { Hex } from '@lapo/asn1js/hex.js';
```

If your code is still not using ES6 Modules (and is using CommonJS) you can `require` it normally [since NodeJS 22](https://joyeecheung.github.io/blog/2024/03/18/require-esm-in-node-js/) (with parameter `--experimental-require-module`):

```js
const
  { ASN1 } = require('@lapo/asn1js'),
  { Hex } = require('@lapo/asn1js/hex.js');
console.log(ASN1.decode(Hex.decode('06032B6570')).content());
```

On older NodeJS you instead need to use async `import`:

```js
async function main() {
  const
    { ASN1 } = await import('@lapo/asn1js'),
    { Hex } = await import('@lapo/asn1js/hex.js');
  console.log(ASN1.decode(Hex.decode('06032B6570')).content());
}
main();
```

Usage on the web
--------------------

Can be [tested on JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/lapo/y6t2wo7q/).

```html
<script>
import { ASN1 } from 'https://unpkg.com/@lapo/asn1js@2.0.0/asn1.js';
import { Hex } from 'https://unpkg.com/@lapo/asn1js@2.0.0/hex.js';

document.body.innerText = ASN1.decode(Hex.decode('06032B6570')).content();
</script>
```

Local usage
--------------------

Since unfortunately ESM modules are not working on `file:` protocol due to [CORS issues](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#other_differences_between_modules_and_standard_scripts), there is a bundled [single-file version working locally](https://asn1js.eu/index-local.html). It doesn't work online (due to [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) restrictions about inline content) but can be saved locally and opened in a browser.

Usage from CLI
--------------------

You can dump an ASN.1 structure from the command line using the following command (no need to even install it):

```sh
npx @lapo/asn1js ed25519.cer
```
